@todo
you have to push your repo somewhere else or squareone doesn't know what to do with it -- should you be able to deploy from local repo?
rollback
deploy(hash)
test addition and removal of other users -- this might be broken in louis.  also, when adding new users, that doesn't update the production server.
or if you have multiple boxes, you might want different users/permissions on different boxes (for example, all my hired devs get permissions on dev server, but only i can push to prod)


@LEASELY QUESTIONS
"filename" template tag?
email or auth backend

change database info in production-settings.py

add your ssh keys to deploy/ssh
add your new servers nickname and ip address to louisconf
create an entry for yourself in SYSADMINS in louisconf

fab $server:root init_server
[you'll be prompted for root password, then fab will setup the new box]

fab $server:$username setup_postgres:$project,$password
fab $server:$username setup_project:$project


users.py:add_ssh_keys left "keys" file in my home directory

todo:
change to list of ip addresses for boxes
louis should download its own dependencies (at least fabric)fa
restart apache, prompt for passphrase if required


add server to louisconf
fab ot:root init_server
fab ot:ezl create_postgres_user:leasely,PASSWORD
fab ot:ezl create_postgres_db:leasely,leasely
fab ot:ezl setup_project:leasely,git@codebasehq.com:ezl/leasely/leasely.git,falafel.leasely.com,falafel.leasely.com
install mxdatetime to virtualenv


users.py:16 doesn't seem to actually remove file keys? why?

Why the F can't we pip install this?

is it a problem that this SECRET key isn't unique? (all other squareone projects will share it)
