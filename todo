projects.py: if repo exists, asks if you want to reclone it.
fab file does not syncdb. problem.

@todo
should we use templates at all? i think there should be a local init file in squareone that sets up the next project.
add virtualenvwrapper to the project user
rename site title in templates
create README
you have to push your repo somewhere else or squareone doesn't know what to do with it

@todo
test addition and removal of other users


managers vs admins? in settings.py, MANAGERS = ADMINS.  But since ADMINS isn't set until after that line (in the production0settings, that isn't set)


@LEASELY QUESTIONS
"filename" template tag?
email or auth backend
wtf does admin files do?

after fabric setup_project, have to do 3 things. log in and:
1. set up syncdb that baby with the right settings
2. easy_install egenix-mx-base, as per http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2009/07/using-psycopg2-virtualenv-ubuntu-jaunty/
3. restart apache

~YAY.







change database info in production-settings.py

add your ssh keys to deploy/ssh
add your new servers nickname and ip address to louisconf
create an entry for yourself in SYSADMINS in louisconf

fab $server:root init_server
[you'll be prompted for root password, then fab will setup the new box]

fab $server:$username setup_postgres:$project,$password
fab $server:$username setup_project:$project





deployment on falafel is messed up.  looks like falafel, but identifying as www.  how do you fix that?

missing s on projectname in wsgi file ??
correction on postgres creation 
if password contains "=" messes up.  how to escape it?

todo:
one command deployment
postgres create user doesn't work (no quotes around username)
prompt for parameters in setup_project and postgres_user and postgres_db
change to list of ip addresses for boxes
change hard-coded stuff like "production-server" .  all boxes have their own "local_settings"
louis should download its own dependencies (at least fabric)fa
restart apache, prompt for passphrase if required

install mx



add server to louisconf
fab ot:root init_server
fab ot:ezl create_postgres_user:leasely,PASSWORD
fab ot:ezl create_postgres_db:leasely,leasely
fab ot:ezl setup_project:leasely,git@codebasehq.com:ezl/leasely/leasely.git,falafel.leasely.com,falafel.leasely.com
install mxdatetime to virtualenv






last:
check for isntances of "leasely" and "squareone"

questions for rz:
do we care about html5lib as a dependency for squareone? why?
users.py:16 doesn't seem to actually remove file keys? why?

Why the F can't we pip install this?

notes
i removed NOTIFICATIONS_ENABLED since i removed django-notification -- any reason to keep django-notification in this repo? I vote not.
what is all this email host port backend garbage?
is it a problem that this SECRET key isn't unique? (all other squareone projects will share it)
