squareone is "django-admin.py startproject" with a few bells and whistles.
squareone uses fabric and louis to make deploying on a new server and updating easy.
louis is designed to deploy and update from git repos.

HOW TO MAKE SQUAREONE WORK FOR YOU

@ Instructions.

work in a virtualenv

@@ Clone the squareone repository

@@ Add your ssh key to the ssh key path defined in louisconf (default is: projectroot/deploy/ssh/<your-id_rsa.pub>)

@@ Edit louisconf.py
add the host(s) in the HOSTS tuple
add yourself to the SYSADMINS dict:
  the key for the dict will be your username. The ssh key will be used for authentication (password auth is disabled by louis)

other parameters should be self explanatory.

@@ Create a new git repo to house the project you are about to start.
Repo must be accessible from any machine you want to deploy your project.

from the project root (where the fabfile and louisconf live)
rm -rf .git (blast the existing git repo for square one.  you can't push to it anyways.)
git init "projectname"
git remote add somewhere like github
git commit
git push

$ fab foo:root init_server (this sets up the server. you have to log in as root. this will do a whole bunch of installation garbage and take ~5 min)
$ fab foo:<your username as specified in the SYSADMINS> giddyup

thats all folks
